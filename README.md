# Arduino-True-DAC
Implements a true 12-bit DAC on Arduino pins 2 - 13 with R-2R resistor ladder

The Digital-Analog Converter (DAC) is constructed with pins 2 - 13 as digital outputs.
The R-2R ladder is connected to the pins as shown in the diagram.
The output voltage changes from 0 to 5 V corresponding to the DAC setting integer variable ranged from 0 to 4095.
